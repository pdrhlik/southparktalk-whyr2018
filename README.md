# Going Down to South Park to Make Some Tidytext Analysis

This is a repository of a lightning talk that I gave at the [Why R? 2018 conference](http://whyr2018.pl/) in Wroc≈Çaw. It was created using [slidify](https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify) and the result can be seen at [this GitHub page](https://pdrhlik.github.io/southparktalk-whyr2018/). All the data was scraped and analysed using the R [southparkr](https://github.com/pdrhlik/southparkr) package.

## Abstract

South Park is a famous American TV show that tells a story of four nine year old boys. It is widely known as being very satiric and that most of the characters use lots of naughty words. In this talk, I will present my results of a text analysis done mostly using the R tidytext package by Julia Silge and David Robinson. The main question that I will answer is: Who is the naugthiest chracter in the series? Even those people who know the TV show will be surprised by the results. I will also show a simple sentiment analysis or episode popularity based on IMDB ratings. Do you think that the naughtiest episodes are more popular? We will find out.
